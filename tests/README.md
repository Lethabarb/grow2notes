# tests

Automated tests for Grow2Notes (design.md §7.3, §10.4).

- `Grow2Notes.Tests/`: xUnit v3 unit tests and API integration tests. The integration tests host the app with
  `WebApplicationFactory` against a real SQL Server in Testcontainers, so Docker must be running.
- `e2e/`: Playwright smoke tests with axe accessibility checks, run against the published app.
